# COMPARATIVE STUDY OF Hybrid RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS

The rapidly developing e-commerce sector has increased the demand for effective recommendation systems to provide clients with personalized and accurate product recommendations. These systems are critical in improving the customer experience, increasing sales, and cultivating customer loyalty. While traditional recommendation systems depend solely on star ratings for evaluating customer satisfaction, recent research has demonstrated the value of using sentiment analysis to capture the nuances and emotions represented in textual evaluations. This project aims to contribute to the area by undertaking comparative research on hybrid recommendation systems for e-commerce, emphasising integrating sentiment analysis and star ratings using the weighted hybrid approach. Other objectives of this project include:

- Performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews.
- Analyze the direction and strength of the correlation to assess the alignment between
sentiment and star ratings
- Identifying keywords used in customer reviews and exploring the relationship between keywords and customer behaviours.
